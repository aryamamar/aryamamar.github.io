    <h3>How We Met</h3>
        <p>
            Moon was the catalyst for the cat population in our house. Part of a litter of strays in a wooded neighbourhood and almost 2 months old by the time we came to pick him up. Moon as a kitten was very sweet and active in the first week or so but very quickly got ill. It started off with sneezing, then a limp. This would lead up to several months of vet visits, medical attention, and him getting very nearly euthenized because the vet suggested it would be the best option. I was Moon's main caretaker and he is still my baby to this day but he's his own cat now. We thankfully were able to find a vet who was able to help us treat him and I thank her from the bottom of my heart. He would eventually get better but the time spent with his front elbows atrophied has left him with just the slightest limp. No worries though, he's by far one of the most agile cats in the house!

           <h3>Fun Facts</h3>

            Moon is named after Renaldo "Muta" Moon from The Cat Returns.

            A purring machine, he starts purring almost immediately after picking him up.
