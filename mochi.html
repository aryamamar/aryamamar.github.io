         <h3>How We Met</h3>
        <p>
            Mochi is the most recent addition to the household and another proud member of the orange cats. There's this notion that orange cats have collectively 1 brain cell and all the personality in the world (crazy), but honestly I think that's just how most cats are. We found Mochi when she was very young, a friend of my mom had a son who fed strays and Mochi's mom had very early on left her to her own devices so my mom took pity (as she always does for every cat she sees, helpless or otherwise) and we started operation orange kitty. Involving my other sisters into smuggling her into the house. My dad eventually found out but has resigned himself to my mom's antics and has no issues with Mochi. Unlikely her other orange brothers, her kittenhood has been gracefully uneventful, no illnesses life threathening or chronic, have popped up and she spends most of her time bounding around the house and picking fights with Leo.
