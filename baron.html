     <h3>How We Met</h3>
        <p>
            Baron is Moon's litter mate. One of about 5 remaining kitties after a few had succumbed to illnesses or wild animals. We picked up Baron a week after we got Moon so they could be playmates. Baron had a much more tame personality. Still playful but more reserved. Like Moon he also got sick, but in a different manner. He has a chronic condition where there is a polyp inside his left ear that makes that specific ear very dirty. We clean it regularly and he has otherwise been fine. It's very likely that both Moon and Baron's parents were siblings so we just attribute all their maladies to that. Baron is very compactly shaped and despite his almost gruff personality will let you do just about anything to him.

            The sweetest right after he wakes up; otherwise very stoic cat who is afraid of thunder.
