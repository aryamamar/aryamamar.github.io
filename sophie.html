        <h3>How We Met</h3>
        <p>
            My mom saw a Facebook post about what someone thought to be a stray kitten near our house and immediately went to me about it. She knows I have a bleeding heart and unlike everyone else in the house would not try to convince her out of it. So operation gray kitty was underway and before my dad could object we had another cat in the house. And for a few weeks we were scared we would have a litter more. For context she came to us, as round as a ball. We thought she was pregnant at first but after a vet visit or two they said it was likely she had given birth recently or was simply chunky. She's lost some weight now and her acclimation to the house went pretty smoothly. She did run away a couple of times, which was a given since she was a street cat for about a year before we got her, but by now she's become fully indoor. She's actually quite good with people but just has some boundaries and is not afraid of biting someone if they get too crazy with her or occasionally just  swiping at your heels while passing by. Because of that no one else in the house is willing to pick her up but me; that's cause after dealing with Leo, I really had no fear about being clawed or bit, it was simply a waiting game.
