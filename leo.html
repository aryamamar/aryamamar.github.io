      <h3>How We Met</h3>
        <p>
            Leo is a fancy cat. A full-bred siamese, from a professional breeder's house. However due to personal circumstances his owner had to give up many of his cats and my mom happened to know him and he trusted her with Leo. He was already 5 years old by the time he came home and understandably very distressed with his new environment. Previously he lived in a home with 10 other siamese cats and he was loved by his owner but often bullied by his siblings. His first night in our house was spent hiding away and it took several months and careful interactions to convince him that we meant well. I'm a pet person so I really wanted him to get along with us and after a while he started spending more time in my room before eventually making it his own space. He loves sleeping next to my head and is often hard at work making biscuits. He sits the most regal and we love to joke that he would simply not survive outside being the ubber fancy cat that he is.

           <h4> Nick Name: Weo</h4>
           <p>
            
            Leo is short for Leonardo, but we never call him that.
