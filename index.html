            Hi! My name is Aryam and I know what you're thinking...5 cats!? That's a lot! Yes. Yes it is. But you're not here to listen to me and my woes of managing endless vet visits (and costs), you're here to meet the babies.

            <em>Have you ever heard of the cat distribution system?</em>
            It's a funny little thing people have noticed about owning cats. Which is that somehow when the universe(or cat) decides it, you are now a cat owner.
            I've never meet anyone personally who's bought a cat. In fact, we haven't either, but you'll hear more about that in each kitty's story.
            Long story short, if you want a cat, then by the powers vested into the universe and kittykind, you'll probably find yourself with a cat soon enough.
        </p>

        <h3>The Backstory</h3>
        <p>
            Before we had cats, we had dogs. Two of them! And not to worry they get along with the cats...most of them. We had two labradoodles, a brother and sister born 1 week apart; same father different mothers. We named them Titan and Primrose.  And for a long time we were happy with them (still very much are, we love those two). But then one day my mom started mentioning how she knew someone who had kittens and was interested. This was news to all of us. My mom, known cat disliker suddenly throwing out the suggestion for cats? The world must be upside down (now she's an adamant cat lover, we'd have more than 5 cats if she had it her way). So we made plans to pick up a kitty, and then 1 became 2, then 3, 4, 5.

            <h3>Very Important Disclaimer</h3>
            Do not just pick up any cat out there, ESPECIALLY if you are not equipped to take care of it or know someone who can. We all love and want animals to be safe but if they look healthy and don't want your help, PLEASE LEAVE THEM ALONE.
